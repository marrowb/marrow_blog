# Simple Test Post

This is a simple test post without any frontmatter.

It should still be processed correctly, with the title extracted from the first heading.

## Content Section

Here's some basic content:

- Simple list item
- Another item

**Bold text** and *italic text* should work fine.

This post tests the document processor's ability to handle markdown without frontmatter.
